# Explanation:
# The program starts by displaying the menu and asking the user to enter their choice.
# If the user chooses to add an item to the cart, they are presented with a list of
# items and their prices. The user can then enter the item number to add it to the cart.
# The program adds the item to the cart and updates the total price.
# If the user chooses to remove an item from the cart, they are presented with the current
# cart contents. The user can then enter the item number to remove it from the cart.
# The program removes the item from the cart and updates the total price.
# If the user chooses to view the cart, the program displays the current cart contents
# and the total price.
# If the user chooses to checkout, the program displays the final cart contents and
# the total price, and then exits.
# If the user chooses to exit, the program exits.
# If the user enters an invalid choice, the program displays an error message and
# asks the user to try again.
# The program continues to display the menu and process the user's choice until the user
# chooses to
# exit.
# The program uses global variables to keep track of the cart contents and the total price.
# The program uses a list to store the items and their prices.
# The program uses functions to implement the different menu options, making the code
# more modular and easier to read.
# The program uses a while loop to repeatedly display the menu and process the user's
# choice until the user chooses to exit.
# The program uses an if-elif-else statement to determine which menu option the user
# has chosen.
# The program uses list indexing to access the items and prices in the list.
# The program uses the exit() function to exit the program when the user chooses to exit.
# The program uses the print() function to display the menu, the cart contents, and the
# total price.
# The program uses the input() function to get the user's choice and the item number.
# The program uses the int() function to convert the user's choice to an integer.
# The program uses the append() method to add an item to the cart.
# The program uses the pop() method to remove an item from the cart.
# The program uses the index() method to find the index of an item in the list.
# The program uses f-strings to format the output.
# The program uses comments to explain the code and provide context.
# The program uses a docstring to describe the purpose of the program.
# The program uses a global variable to keep track of the total price.
# The program uses a global variable to store the cart contents.

# Summary:
# This program is a shopping cart program that allows the user to add items to the cart,
# remove items from the cart, view the cart contents, and checkout. The program uses
# a list to store the items and their prices, and a list to store the cart contents. The

# uses list indexing to access the items and prices in the list. The program uses the exit()
# function to exit the program when the user chooses to exit.
